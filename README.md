## Planning

The process started with planning user stories and a wireframe, with the ERD coming after most of the front end was complete. The idea has been done many times over, but it serves as a great introduction to React.

## User Stories

- Users should be able to see the sprite and type(s) of the original 151 pokédex

- Users should be able to live-search the pokédex by name or pokédex number

- Users should be able to see details of the pokémon such as moves and base-stats

- Users should be able to add and remove pokémon to their own pokédex
